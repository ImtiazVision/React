# React

**React** is a javascript library i.e. collection of scripts to make developers life easier and accomplish tasks such as creating Front End Applications.Everything is build as a component in react. The benefit of using component is that of its reusability as we don't have to write the same code over and over again. Instead of created separate HTML, CSS, Javascript files, everything can be written inside a Javascript file and rendered as a component if needed. Within a component, we write the logic of it and use (customize) it accordingly. As data changes in our application or server, the component changes accordingly. For example, if the price of a specific product changes, we don't have to change its price everywhere within the application. It is because component updates the data automatically. Hence, React is so popular amongst developers nowadays. 

Because React is a view-only library, it can be effortlessly integrated with any other library or framework (it is the view part of the Model View Controler MVC architectural UI pattern). The ability to utilize any other framework and library allows for experimentation and hence innovation.

**Reminder** Focus more on building a working application rather than tools and features. We will learn them as we go along. It is a process and it will take time.
