# React

Everything is build as a component in react. The benefit of using component is that of its reusability as we don't have to write the same code over and over again. Instead of created separate HTML, CSS, Javascript files, everything can be written inside a Javascript file and rendered as a component if needed. Within a component, we write the logic of it and use it accordingly.
